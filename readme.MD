# Temp Cleaner
**Hello There**, you can use me to clean **Temporary Files** on your **Windows Machine**!
--------
Whenever you use a software or a program, they may need to write some files on your local hard drive to be able to do what they want to accomplish. After it is done, normally the temporary files get cleaned automatically, but many of the times, they are not and as a consequence, they just occupy your free drive space! So we need to manually clean those remaining temporary files!

You can clean them using **Disk Cleanup** in Windows or even using the **Run Command**, but if you want a **simpler and faster approach**, you can use this app called **Temp Cleaner** to clean temporary files on your Windows PC! Moreover, it can even clean your **Recycle Bin**!

## Features
- Clean Windows Temporary files (temp)
- Clean User Temporary files in AppData folder (%temp%)
- Clean your Recycle Bin
- Clean Windows Prefetch files (Windows Memory Management files)
- A **Clean All** button to clean everything in one go!

## How to Use Temp Cleaner:
Just download the Latest Release from the Releases option (**Download .exe file**), or just [Click Here to Download](https://github.com/vaibhavkrkm/Temp-Cleaner/releases/tag/v2.5 "Click Here to Download")!

Then, you **must run it as Administrator** to use it properly!
And, then you are good to go!

***NOTE***: *Sometimes, it will seem that the app is not able to clean some files, this is normal because many of those files might still be used by some applications and forcing to delete them manually might cause issues and crash the running applications either in foreground or background!*
